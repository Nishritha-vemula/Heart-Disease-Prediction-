# Heart-Disease-Prediction-

This project dives into heart disease data to uncover patterns, trends, and possible risk factors.  
Using Python, we clean the dataset, explore its features, and build visualizations that make the findings easier to understand.

## What's Inside
- **Jupyter Notebook:** All analysis is in `Heart Disease project (6).ipynb`
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding the dataset and checking for missing or unusual values
- **Visualizations:** Heatmaps, charts, and graphs to bring the data to life

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nishritha-vemula/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Open the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook "Heart Disease project .ipynb"
```

## Requirements
This project uses:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

All are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Why This Project Exists
The idea is to take a medical dataset and turn it into clear, visual insights.  
This isn’t medical advice — just an analytical look at the data to help understand the bigger picture.
